# GraphQL-Intro

**Bonusing Example**

The section provides an interactive environment to explore queries and mutations in GraphQL, 
with a mock Bonusing database and visualisation with Graph*i*QL.

1) Install all dependencies: `npm install`
2) Run mock database: `npm run json-server`
3) Start this example GraphQL server: `npm run start`

View Graph*i*QL page at *localhost:2019/graphql*

Bonusing jackpots have IDs of *"j1", "j2", "j3" and "j4"*. Any new jackpots you create will be
assigned a system generated ID. All database entries can be seen in the file *db.json*.

Events have IDs of *"e1", "e2", ..."e18"*.
